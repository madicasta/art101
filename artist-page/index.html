        <h1>Madisen Correa Castaneda</h1>

        <p>Madisen Castaneda is a Mexican American artist based in San Jose,
        CA. She has been making art for the past five years, primarily
        working digitally with programs Procreate on Ipad and Paint Tool
        Sai on PC. She also loves working other forms of art, especially
        ceramics and with charcoal. Originally, Madisenn started off as a
        self taught artist and later became an art student at San Jose City
        Community College, then transfered to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
        <p>From a young age, Madisen has been infatuated with fantasy worlds
          and tales from different times. This sparked her to create concept
          art of characters and environments. Much of her work has drawn heavy
          inspriation from media like anime, comics, and indie/alternative
          music.</p>
