				<h1>Madisen Correa Castaneda</h1>
				<p>My name is Madisen Castaneda and I'm a fifth year art student.
				I was born and raised in San Jose, CA and I'm a second generation
				Mexican. I specialize in digital art and focus on character design
				or just making fanart of whatever I'm into at the time.</p>

				<p>My art is heavily influenced by my interests and I often find
				inspriration from them. I'm a big fan of comics, anime and manga,
				fiction, and fantasy. I also love listening to indie/alternative rock
				. Some of my favorite artists are Mother Mother, Sufjan Stevens, and
				SALES. Some medias that I really enjoy are Homestuck, Overlord,
				and the Jurassic Park Trilogy.</p>
