	<p>My javascript did not want to appear even though I triple checked it
	and everything. I also checked my indx.html file and that seemed right
	as well. I'm not sure what's wrong with it. My 'id="content' does not want
  to reconginze my text as content for some reason no matter how many times
  I retype it or copy and past it from somewhere else. I know it's not working
  because usually 'id' is blue but it is orange no matter what.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> None :(</p>
