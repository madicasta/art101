  <p>
  I wasn't able to get my JavaScript to link properly, that or I didn't input
  my commands properly. I don't think that's the case though because I used
  the same code that we used in class with Wes so maybe I just didn't order
  something right. Coding is hard :(
	</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Thankfully the CSS linked properly and the HTML commands are functioning,
    though the actual functions of JavaScript do not work.</p>
